	abstract = {A two-pass spatial transform technique that does not exhibit the aliasing artifacts associated with techniques for spatial transform of discrete sampled images is possible through the use of a complete and continuous resampling interpolation algorithm. The algorithm is complete in the sense that all the pixels of the input image under the map of the output image fully contribute to the output image. It is continuous in the sense that no gaps or overlaps exist in the sampling of the input pixels and that the sampling can be performed with arbitrary precision. The technique is real time in the sense that it can be guaranteed to operate for any arbitrary transform within a given time limit. Because of the complete and continuous nature of the resampling algorithm, the resulting image is free of the classic sampling artifacts such as graininess, degradation, and edge aliasing.},
