	abstract = {After leaving the electron source, the beam follows the central (optic) axis of the lens system and is sequentially defined by apertures and focused by the magnetic and/or electrostatic fields of the lens system. Within the final (objective) lens, a system of scan coils acts to displace the beam off the optic axis so that it can be addressed to a location on the specimen, as illustrated schematically for single deflection scanning in Fig. 6.1. At any particular time, there is only one ray path (solid line) through the scanning system and the beam reaches only one location on the specimen, for example, position 3 in Fig. 6.1. The SEM image is a geometric construction created under computer control by addressing the focused beam to a sequence of discrete x-y locations on the specimen and measuring the effect of the interaction of the beam with the specimen at each location. For a single gray-scale SEM image, this interaction could be the output from a single electron detector, such as the Everhart–Thornley detector. It is also possible to measure the output from more than one detector simultaneously while the beam is addressed to a single x-y location. When this is done, multiple gray-scale SEM images are built up at the same time during the scan. It is essential to realize that even when these multiple signals are being collected simultaneously and multiple images are produced, only a single scan is needed; the parallel nature of the acquisition arises from parallel detection, not parallel scanning. Note that no “true image” actually exists within the SEM in the same sense as the image created in a light optical microscope, where actual ray paths extend from each point on the specimen through the lens system to a corresponding point on the image recording medium, whether that is the eye of a human viewer or the positionally sensitive detector of a digital camera. In the SEM, at each location sampled by the incident electron beam, each signal is measured with an appropriate detector and the analog measurement is converted to an equivalent digital value (using an analog-to-digital converter, ADC). The beam x-y location and the intensity(ies) Ij of the signal(s) of interest generate a digital stream of data packets (x, y, Ij), where j represent the various signals available: backscattered electrons (BSE), secondary electrons (SE), absorbed current, x-rays, cathodoluminescence, etc.},

	abstract = "{The extended Rayleigh resolution measure was introduced to give a generalized resolution measure that can be readily applied to imaging and resolving particles that have finite size. Here, we make a detailed analysis of the influence of the particle size on this resolution measure. We apply this to scanning electron microscopy, under simple assumption of a Gaussian electron beam intensity distribution and a directly proportional emitted signal yield without detailed consideration of scattering internal to the sample, other than being proportional to the sample thickness. From this, we produce beam-width normalized characteristics relating the particle diameter and resolution measure, while also taking consideration of the reduced signal yield that occurs from smaller particles. From our analysis of these characteristics, which we fit to experimental image data, we see that particle diameters \\&lt;0.7 times the beam 1/e full width, d, give agreement better than 10\\% with the true extended Rayleigh resolution. Furthermore, we consider the signal current that must be collected to reliably distinguish between the mid-gap and peak intensity regions in the particle images. This leads to a practical guide that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) occurring between large area, continuous regions made of the same materials as the particle and background should typically be 10–30 times greater than the SNR that is desired to be achieved between the peak and mid-gap regions of just resolved adjacent identical particles having diameters in the size range 0.4–0.7d.}",
