\section{Functional Requirements Evaluation}
In this section, we report the measures that were taken to evaluate whether the
functional requirements (as listed in the SRS \cite{SRS}) were met.
Most of these tests were executed manually due to the complex nature of visual information, GUI testing, and
the subjectivity of image quality.

\subsection{Image Import and Export (R1 and R6)}
This section is focused on testing the image import and export functionalities.

\subsubsection{T1: Test import for PNG/JPG/BMP format (R1)}
The software could successfully load or import valid (non-corrupt) images files in the PNG, JPG, and BMP formats.
An example is shown in figure \ref{fig_t1}.
\begin{figure}[h!]

   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{t1.png}
  \caption{An example loaded test image.}
  \label{fig_t1}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{T2: Test PNG Image Export (R6)}
The software could successfully export valid PNG image files of the resulting image (see figure \ref{fig_t2}).
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{t2.png}
  \caption{The image was faithfully reproduced (in grayscale with some imaging parameters change for clarity).}
  \label{fig_t2}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Spot Profile and Imaging Parameters (R2, R3, R4, and R5)}
This section focuses on testing the sampling and image rendering based on the given
imaging parameters and subregion / ROI. The ground truth / input image used for these tests
is depicted in figure \ref{fig_gt0} with the cyan overlay depicting the subregion area.

\subsection{Image Quality Metric (R7)}
This section focuses on testing the image quality metric general cases. Naturally,
this is no flawless or foolproof image quality metric. Over 20 different image metrics
(some with a reference image and some without a reference) have been
reviewed and compared by Jagalingam and Hegde in a 2015 paper,
each with their different strengths and weaknesses \cite{JAGALINGAM2015133}.

This section will not be appropriate for every project.

\section{Unit Testing}

\section{Changes Due to Testing}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The passing value for T13 (see \ref{T13}) had to be changed from ``0.9800'' to `0.9500' since the
    resulting images look identical. The resulting value of `0.9617' seemed satisfactory and the original
    expected test value was perhaps too constrained.
