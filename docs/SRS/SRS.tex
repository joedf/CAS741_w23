\section{Introduction}

Images formed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) are created using a 
specific process where the image quality can be greatly influenced by the 
imaging parameters given by the user, aside from any inherent electron 
optics limitation of a given instrument. The motivation of this project is 
to be able visualize qualitatively the influence of the spot profile 
(shape and size) and the rastering parameters (such as pixel size). Since the 
quality of an image is very often evaluated subjectively by an experienced 
microscope user, the idea behind this software is provide a way to show 
that adjusting the imaging parameters could lead to a loss of information 
or misinterpretation. Is is also to prove or disprove if there is a "rule 
of thumb" for the optimal spot-to-pixel size ratio.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

This document serves as the software specification. The details of the 
requirements, limitations, definitions, models to be used are laid explicitly 
within this document.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

The scope of the requirements of this software is restricted to only the image 
formation process used in SEMs, more specifically the image processing from 
signal to an image or visual representions. It does not cover election-sample 
interactions or CCD (charge coupled device) detector voltage to signal value 
conversion. See the assumptions section (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}) for further 
details.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

The intended reader of this document should have a basic understanding of 
electron-optics concepts used in an SEM. This can be equated to a standard level 
two university physics (optics, electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics and 
modern physics) along with a standard undergraduate course related to materials 
characterization (concepts such as backscattered electrons, mean free path, and 
electron density). The reader should have a basic understanding of two-dimensional 
image processing techniques.

\subsection{Organization of Document}

This document contains an introduction to the software and its goals. It is 
meant to be a reference document to the readers and is based on a SRS template from \citet{SmithAndLai2005, SmithEtAl2007}. The document include a 
description of the scope, a detailed list of the terminology, definitions, and 
models used, as well as a more specific and detailed description of the problem 
and its solutions. This document also defines the requirements, as well as the  
likely changes and traceability details.

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.

\plt{The purpose of this section is to provide general information about the
  system so the specific requirements in the next section will be easier to
  understand. The general system description section is designed to be
  changeable independent of changes to the functional requirements documented in
  the specific system description. The general system description provides a
  context for a family of related models.  The general description can stay the
  same, while specific details are changed between family members.}

\subsection{System Context}

\plt{Your system context will include a figure that shows the abstract view of
  the software.  Often in a scientific context, the program can be viewed
  abstractly following the design pattern of Inputs $\rightarrow$ Calculations
  $\rightarrow$ Outputs.  The system context will therefore often follow this
  pattern.  The user provides inputs, the system does the calculations, and then
  provides the outputs to the user.  The figure should not show all of the
  inputs, just an abstract view of the main categories of inputs (like material
  properties, geometry, etc.).  Likewise, the outputs should be presented from
  an abstract point of view.  In some cases the diagram will show other external
  entities, besides the user.  For instance, when the software product is a
  library, the user will be another software program, not an actual end user.
  If there are system constraints that the software must work with external
  libraries, these libraries can also be shown on the System Context diagram.
  They should only be named with a specific library name if this is required by
  the system constraint.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{SystemContextFigure}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\plt{For each of the entities in the system context diagram its responsibilities
  should be listed.  Whenever possible the system should check for data quality,
  but for some cases the user will need to assume that responsibility.  The list
  of responsibilites should be about the inputs and outputs only, and they
  should be abstract.  Details should not be presented here.  However, the
  information should not be so abstract as to just say ``inputs'' and
  ``outputs''.  A summarizing phrase can be used to characterize the inputs.
  For instance, saying ``material properties'' provides some information, but it
  stays away from the detail of listing every required properties.}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\item \progname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a
  floating point number
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

\plt{This section summarizes the knowledge/skills expected of the user.
  Measuring usability, which is often a required non-function requirement,
  requires knowledge of a typical user.  As mentioned above, the user is a
  different role from the ``intended reader,'' as given in
  Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}.  As in Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}, the
  user characteristics should be specific an unambiguous.  For instance, ``The
  end user of \progname{} should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1
  Calculus and Physics.''}

\subsection{System Constraints}

\plt{System constraints differ from other type of requirements because they
  limit the developers' options in the system design and they identify how the
  eventual system must fit into the world. This is the only place in the SRS
  where design decisions can be specified.  That is, the quality requirement for
  abstraction is relaxed here.  However, system constraints should only be
  included if they are truly required.}

\section{Specific System Description}

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models.

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

\progname{} is intended to help visualize and understand the influence of the 
spot profile and pixel size. It should be able to help determine the optimal 
spot-to-pixel-size ratio.

\subsubsection{Terminology and Definitions}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

        \bottomrule
    \end{longtable} 
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}

\plt{The purpose of this section is to clearly and unambiguously state the
  physical system that is to be modelled. Effective problem solving requires a
  logical and organized approach. The statements on the physical system to be
  studied should cover enough information to solve the problem. The physical
  description involves element identification, where elements are defined as
  independent and separable items of the physical system. Some example elements
  include acceleration due to gravity, the mass of an object, and the size and
  shape of an object. Each element should be identified and labelled, with their
  interesting properties specified clearly. The physical description can also
  include interactions of the elements, such as the following: i) the
  interactions between the elements and their physical environment; ii) the
  interactions between elements; and, iii) the initial or boundary conditions.}

The physical system of \progname{}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig_ebeam} and \ref{fig_sampling},
includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}

\item[PS1:] 

\item[PS2:] ...

\end{itemize}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Goal Statements}

\noindent Given an image, the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_easeofuse}:] {
A user-friendly straight forward tool to load and reprocess an image with options following the SEM image formation process.
}

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_metric}:] {
Provide a quantitative metric of relative image quality of the resulting image created from the given parameters and input image (as ground truth).
}

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_visualize}:] {
The ability to visualize and export the reprocessed images.
}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}

\plt{This section specifies the information in the solution domain of the system
  to be developed. This section is intended to express what is required in
  such a way that analysts and stakeholders get a clear picture, and the
  latter will accept it. The purpose of this section is to reduce the problem
  into one expressed in mathematical terms. Mathematical expertise is used to
  extract the essentials from the underlying physical description of the
  problem, and to collect and substantiate all physical data pertinent to the
  problem.}

\plt{This section presents the solution characteristics by successively refining
  models.  It starts with the abstract/general Theoretical Models (TMs) and
  refines them to the concrete/specific Instance Models (IMs).  If necessary
  there are intermediate refinements to General Definitions (GDs).  All of these
  refinements can potentially use Assumptions (A) and Data Definitions (DD).
  TMs are refined to create new models, that are called GMs or IMs. DDs are not
  refined; they are just used. GDs and IMs are derived, or refined, from other
  models. DDs are not derived; they are just given. TMs are also just given, but
  they are refined, not used.  If a potential DD includes a derivation, then
  that means it is refining other models, which would make it a GD or an IM.}

\plt{The above makes a distinction between ``refined'' and ``used.'' A model is
  refined to another model if it is changed by the refinement. When we change a
  general 3D equation to a 2D equation, we are making a refinement, by applying
  the assumption that the third dimension does not matter. If we use a
  definition, like the definition of density, we aren't refining, or changing
  that definition, we are just using it.}

\plt{The same information can be a TM in one problem and a DD in another.  It is
  about how the information is used.  In one problem the definition of
  acceleration can be a TM, in another it would be a DD.}

\plt{There is repetition between the information given in the different chunks
  (TM, GDs etc) with other information in the document.  For instance, the
  meaning of the symbols, the units etc are repeated.  This is so that the
  chunks can stand on their own when being read by a reviewer/user.  It also
  facilitates reuse of the models in a different context.}

\noindent \plt{The relationships between the parts of the document are show in
  the following figure.  In this diagram ``may ref'' has the same role as
  ``uses'' above.  The figure adds ``Likely Changes,'' which are able to
  reference (use) Assumptions.}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{RelationsBetweenTM_GD_IM_DD_A.pdf}
\end{figure}

The instance models that govern \progname{} are presented in
Subsection~\ref{sec_instance}.  The information to understand the meaning of the
instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance
models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}

\plt{The assumptions are a refinement of the scope.  The scope is general, where
  the assumptions are specific.  All assumptions should be listed, even those
  that domain experts know so well that they are rarely (if ever) written down.}
\plt{The document should not take for granted that the reader knows which
  assumptions have been made. In the case of unusual assumptions, it is
  recommended that the documentation either include, or point to, an explanation
  and justification for the assumption.}

This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the
theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical
system. The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model
[T], general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or
likely change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

\begin{itemize}

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:]
  \plt{Short description of each assumption.  Each assumption
    should have a meaningful label.  Use cross-references to identify the
    appropriate traceability to T, GD, DD etc., using commands like dref, ddref
    etc.  Each assumption should be atomic - that is, there should not be an
    explicit (or implicit) ``and'' in the text of an assumption.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}\label{sec_theoretical}

\plt{Theoretical models are sets of abstract mathematical equations or axioms
  for solving the problem described in Section ``Physical System Description''
  (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}). Examples of theoretical models are
  physical laws, constitutive equations, relevant conversion factors, etc.}

This section focuses on the general equations and laws that \progname{} is based
on.  \plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and add additional models
  as appropriate.}

\plt{``Ref.\ By'' is used repeatedly with the different types of information.
  This stands for Referenced By.  It means that the models, definitions and
  assumptions listed reference the current model, definition or assumption.
  This information is given for traceability.  Ref. By provides a pointer in the
  opposite direction to what we commonly do.  You still need to have a reference
  in the other direction pointing to the current model, definition or
  assumption.  As an example, if T1 is referenced by G2, that means that G2 will
  explicitly include a reference to T1.}

~\newline

\subsubsection{General Definitions}\label{sec_gendef}

\plt{General Definitions (GDs) are a refinement of one or more TMs, and/or of
  other GDs.  The GDs are less abstract than the TMs.  Generally the reduction

Newton's law of cooling describes convective cooling from a surface.  The law is
stated as: the rate of heat loss from a body is proportional to the difference
in temperatures between the body and its surroundings.
\\
& $q(t)$ is the thermal flux (\si{\watt\per\square\metre}).\\

	(\si{\watt\per\square\metre\per\celsius}).\\
&$\Delta T(t)$= $T(t) - T_{\text{env}}(t)$ is the time-dependent thermal gradient
between the environment and the object (\si{\celsius}).

\subsubsection*{Detailed derivation of simplified rate of change of temperature}

\plt{This may be necessary when the necessary information does not fit in the
  description field.}
\plt{Derivations are important for justifying a given GD.  You want it to be
  clear where the equation came from.}

\subsubsection{Data Definitions}\label{sec_datadef}

\plt{The Data Definitions are definitions of symbols and equations that are
  given for the problem.  They are not derived; they are simply used by other
  models.  For instance, if a problem depends on density, there may be a data
  definition for the equation defining density.  The DDs are given information
  that you can use in your other modules.}

\plt{All Data Definitions should be used (referenced) by at least one other
  model.}

This section collects and defines all the data needed to build the instance
models. The dimension of each quantity is also given.  \plt{Modify the examples
  below for your problem, and add additional definitions as appropriate.}

  \hline
  Description & 
                $T_C$ is the temperature of the coil (\si{\celsius}).  $T_W$ is the temperature of the water (\si{\celsius}).  
                The heat flux out of the coil, $q_C$ (\si{\watt\per\square\metre}), is found by
                assuming that Newton's Law 
                of Cooling applies (\aref{A_Newt_coil}).  This law (\dref{NL}) is used on the surface of
                the coil, which has area $A_C$ (\si{\square\metre}) and heat 
                transfer coefficient $h_C$
                (\si{\watt\per\square\metre\per\celsius}).  This equation
                assumes that the temperature of the coil is constant over time (\aref{A_tcoil}) and that it does not vary along the length
                of the coil (\aref{A_tlcoil}).

\subsubsection{Data Types}\label{sec_datatypes}

\plt{This section is optional.  In many scientific computing programs it isn't
  necessary, since the inputs and outpus are straightforward types, like reals,
  integers, and sequences of reals and integers.  However, for some problems it
  is very helpful to capture the type information.}

\plt{The data types are not derived; they are simply stated and used by other
  models.}

\plt{All data types must be used by at least one of the models.}

\plt{For the mathematical notation for expressing types, the recommendation is
  to use the notation of~\citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995}.}

This section collects and defines all the data types needed to document the
models. \plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and add additional
  definitions as appropriate.}

\subsubsection{Instance Models} \label{sec_instance}    

This section transforms the problem defined in Section~\ref{Sec_pd} into 
one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined 
in Section~\ref{sec_datadef} to replace the abstract symbols in the models 
identified in Sections~\ref{sec_theoretical} and~\ref{sec_gendef}.

The goal of reprocessing an image \gsref{G_easeofuse} will be solved by \iref{IM_bitblt}. The goal of providing an image quality metric will be solved by \iref{IM_imageMetric}.

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters in Table~\ref{TblInputVar} are listed in
Table~\ref{TblSpecParams}.

\section{Requirements}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] Accept an input 
image in the following formats:

  \noindent \begin{itemize}
    \item PNG (Portable Net Graphics)
    \item JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
    \item BMP (Bitmap)
    \item preloaded example images
  \end{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_userSpotProfile}:] Accept user 
input of the size and shape of the spot profile and ensure that all its defining 
values are positive real numbers.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_userPixelSize}:] Accept user 
input of pixel size and ensure it is a positive real number.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_subregion}:] Accept user
input to specify a subregion (FOV) for processing.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_easySetup}:] Be easy to use 
with little to no setup required.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_spotLayout}:] Display a 
representative spot layout used for processing the image.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_resultImage}:] Reprocess (
using \iref{IM_bitblt}) and display the resulting image to the user.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_imageMetric}:] Calculate and 
display an image quality metric (according to \iref{IM_imageMetric}) to the user.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

The key nonfunctional requirements of this software are accuracy, usability, 
maintainability, and portability. These are listed below in detail:

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]
  \textbf{Accuracy} The images produced should be not manipulated to produce 
  results that subjectively represent the opinions of the author(s) or 
  developer(s). Thus, the software should transparently follow the 
  specifications and be verifiable by an expert in field. The trends in image 
  quality metric are more important the metric values themselves.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] \textbf{Usability} The user should be able to intuitively use the 
  software and quickly understand what is being displayed. Although the intended 
  use is more of a qualitative nature, the user should be able to grasp any 
  trends in the change of the image quality metric when the input parameters are 
  changed. The software should have a simple user interface and be responsive 
  when given a relatively small input image (ref to assumptions here?).

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
  \textbf{Maintainability} The code should follow a consistent style and
  be reasonably separated in multiple files were it makes sense. Function names 
  should be no longer than 40 characters. Duplicate code should be avoided 
  wherever possible. Comments should be plentiful, but short, and avoid any 
  unnecessary use jargon or domain-specific terms.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
  \textbf{Portability} The software should be cross-platorm (Windows, Linux, 
  MacOS) with little to no setup required. This can be in the form of a 
  web-application in an HTML5 compliant web-browser.

\end{itemize}

\section{Likely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] \plt{Give
    the likely changes, with a reference to the related assumption (aref), as appropriate.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
  means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
  does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.

\section{Development Plan}

\plt{This section is optional.  It is used to explain the plan for developing
  the software.  In particular, this section gives a list of the order in which
  the requirements will be implemented.  In the context of a course  this is
  where you can indicate which requirements will be implemented as part of the
  course, and which will be ``faked'' as future work.  This section can be
  organized as a prioritized list of requirements, or it could should the
  requirements that will be implemented for ``phase 1'', ``phase 2'', etc.}

\section{Values of Auxiliary Constants}
